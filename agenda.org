  We will hold a special lab session tomorrow, Monday 31 January
  11-11.50 AM, to sort out any issues related to Emacs or GCC. Bring
  your own PC to the session, or work on a lab desktop. I will spend the
  time going round to make sure that you can

  * Install/ open / use the Emacs editor
  * Create, run and tangle Org-mode files
  * Install / use the C compiler GCC
  * Understand the recent program assignments

  The necessary steps are also demonstrated [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgb17bzeNygo8GU6SivwwjsQj9QabqAJ][in this tutorial video
  playlist]].

  We will continue with our regular program on Wednesday, 2nd February
  at 11 AM - a short quiz will be available before.

  For those who know or can do all of this already: here's a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/blob/main/assignments/org-mode/2nd_assignment.org][second
  challenge]] (with solution) to practice while I sort others out.

** Objectives

   * [ ] Write a simple, complete C program (~pun.c~)

   * [ ] Submit simple assignment for Friday 4 Feb 11 AM

** Assignment: checkmark program

   Submit program and output as an Org-mode file. It should look like
   this (code block is folded):

* Footnotes

[fn:4]There is actually a package ~restart-emacs~ that you can install
from the Emacs package manager.

[fn:3]I managed to install GCC on the lab computers and run it inside
GNU Emacs. This is something that you should do at home with your own
computer. I'm going to demonstrate the process in class and I will
also make a short video showing how to do it (for Windows 10).

[fn:1]This requires system admin privileges, which you only have on
your own PC. In the computer lab, I have such principles, and as soon
as I managed to install our tools, you can also use them on the lab
equipment.
